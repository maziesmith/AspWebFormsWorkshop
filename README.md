# AspWebFormsWorkshop
* September 19 - 21 ASP.Net Web Forms Workshop
* It didn't make sense that the most junior developer (me) on the team has the most experience with ASP.Net so Lockheed had six of us go
to a three day training for web forms. On of the main reasons we went to this was because I had never had to deploy my changes before
and noone else on the team had any idea how to do it either.
